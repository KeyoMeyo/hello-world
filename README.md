# hello-world

Hey! My name is KeyoMeyo, and I'm a Math major at UAlberta; this is a repository for basic things (for reviewing and figuring things out).

<u>Any</u> changes need to be verified by moi (this is a public <b> personal </b> repository).

If you wanna see a more open-for-collab repository of mine, it'll called <i>'Interesting Projects'</i>
