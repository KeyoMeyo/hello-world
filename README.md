# hello-world
An 'initial' repository

Hey! My name is KeyoMeyo and I'm a Math major at UAlberta, and this is a repository for new things
as well as figuring things out!

Any changes need to be verified by moi (this is a public <b> personal </b> repository after all!)

If you wanna see a more open-for-collab repository of mine, it'll be coming soon!
